### Where Data was obtained for the project: 
"Replication data for Using Fitness Trackers and Smartwatches to Measure Physical Activity in Research"
"This dataset contains a list of 423 consumer-based wrist-worn activity trackers and smart watches, capable of collecting and estimating physical activity levels in individuals, using accelerometer and other sensors. Data were collected by automatic and manual searches through six online and offline databases, as well as manual collecting of data from company web sites. Data were collected in 2017, and contains all identified devices released between 2011 (earliest identified device) and July 2017. For each device, 12 attributes are included...", from https://dataverse.no/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.18710/6ZWC9Z

# Visualizations: 
- Visual 1 (left in index.html): Device Count By Company (Dropdown to filter by companies)
 
- Visual 2 (right in index.html): Trend Growth By Year 

- Visual 3 (bottom in index.html and alone in indexmapvis.html): Global Wearables Map (largest circle with a more device count, smaller circles for smaller device count)

 ### Measurment type: 
- ***Accelerometer:*** An accelerometer is a sensor that measures acceleration or the rate of change of velocity. In a smartwatch, the accelerometer is used to track movement and activity, such as steps taken, distance travelled, and calories burned. It also enables features such as wrist gestures and shake-to-wake.<br><br/>
- ***Gyroscope:*** A gyroscope is a sensor used to measure the orientation and angular rates of the body. When you move your wrist to check your smartwatch, a gyroscope on your wristwatch will notify you in a split second.<br><br/>
- ***Magnetometer:*** A magnetometer is a sensor used to measure magnetic field strength. In smartwatches, it also refers to a compass sensor. This sensor is used to keep track of the motion and direction in which the user is pointing.<br><br/>
- ***Barometer:*** Barometer on your watch automatically measures the altitude and atmospheric pressure at the current location, and shows all data from the current day in a waveform graph form<br><br/>
- ***Heart Rate:*** Photoplethysmography (PPG) is the most commonly used measurement of heart rate for heart rate trackers. As your heart beats, the volume of blood changes within your cardiovascular systems, including the small skin vessels such as your veins and arteries<br><br/>
